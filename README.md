# Calculator-Javascript
This was a caluclator which is being done by `HTML` ,`JS` and `CSS`.

The Hovering features are being added in the [Calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator).

The `javascript` is pretty much new to me, so I have done things which was known to me.<br>
In future the projects will get increased with more *efficient and powerfull*
